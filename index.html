				Hey! 
				<p class = "has-text-justified">
				Call me Saumya (pronounced <i> SAW-myuh</i>).<br>
				I'm a graduate student, pursuing Masters in Computer Science at ASU, currently in my final year. I'll be graduating in May 2018, and am actively looking for full-time opportunities in entry-level positions. As an international student, I am authorized to work in the US for my OPT period, but would later require an H1-B Visa sponsorship to continue working. <br>
				<p><a href = "resume.pdf" target = "_blank"> Here's my resume</a> for an overview of my skills and accomplishments. <br></p>
				You can also take a look at <a href = "projects.html"> some of my projects here. </a></p>
				I strive to be a generalist. I really enjoy analyzing and creating stories out of data. I also love developing applications with strong back-end and user friendly interface. My go-to language is Python. But I have also worked with JavaScript, C, C++, and Java. Currently, I am working on designing a mobile application that provides assistive and personalized navigation to blind users.<br>
