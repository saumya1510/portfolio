				Hey! 
				<p class = "has-text-justified">
				Call me Saumya <sup>[1]</sup> (pronounced <i> SAW-myuh</i>).<br>
				I'm a graduate student, pursuing Masters in Computer Science at ASU, currently in my final year. This portfolio is a work in progress, and being done in haste. I will be graduating in May 2018, and am now actively looking for full-time opportunities in entry-level positions. As an international student, I am authorized to work in the US for my OPT period, but would later require an H1-B Visa sponsorship to continue working. <br>A quick glance at my <a href = "resume.pdf" target = "_blank">resume</a> would give an impression that I'm a "Data Guy", which isn't far from right, as I love working on, and with data. Both my internships involved performing data extraction, cleaning, and statistical analysis. As a pastime, I like developing bots and extracting random information from Reddit, Twitter and Spotify. Besides that, I also love learning new web frameworks and developing end-to-end applications.<br>Currently, I am trying to develop an adaptive system that would monitor some user activities on a particular website via a Chrome extension and provide recommendations based on the implicitly recorded data. It's a part of a course I have taken on Adaptive Web, and combines both my interests: Web Development and Analytics.<br>

				<!--Call me Saumya (pronounced <i> SAW-myuh </i>). Some years ago - never mind how long precisely - having little or no money in my wallet, and nothing particular to interest me on shore, I thought I would sail a little and see the silicony part of the world. It is a way I have of driving off the spleen and regulating the circulation. Whenever I find myself growing grim about the mouth; whenever it is a damp, drizzly November in my soul; whenever I find myself involuntarily pausing before coffin warehouses, and bringing up the rear of every funeral I meet; and especially whenever my hypos get such an upper hand of me, that it requires a strong moral principle to prevent me from deliberately stepping into the street, and methodically knocking people's hats off - then, I account it high time to get to my desk and switch on my IDE as soon as I can. This is my substitute for pistol and ball. With a philosophical flourish Cato throws himself upon his sword; I quietly take to the laptop. There is nothing surprising in this. If they but knew it, almost all men in their degree, some time or other, cherish very nearly the same feelings towards the code with me. -->
