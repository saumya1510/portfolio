								Created a logistic regression model to predict whether a user will click on an ad or not. For this, I used a dummy dataset consisting of various features, such as user's age, daily time spent on site, city, gender, etc. I divided the entire dataset into training and testing sets by 70:30 ratio. The model could classify the test data with an average of 92% precision and 92% recall.

							As part of the course on Data Visualizations (CSE 578) as ASU, I worked in a group of 4 students to develop detailed and comprehensive visualizations on climate change. We used data from the World Bank open data catalog, National Snow and Ice Data Center and Berkeley Earth.  I worked on the two visualizations for Ice Extent, and the animated world map shown on the Combined page, and helped my teammate with the Parallel Coordinated Plot, again on the Combined page. All the visualizations were created on D3.js.<br>
							<sub><i>PS: It appears that the animated map is not functioning properly now. I shall solve the issue as soon as I can...</i></sub></small>
